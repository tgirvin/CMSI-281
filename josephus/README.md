#Josephus

##Background
Josephus is a foster mom for dogs and spends 
her week days rescuing puppies and their moms from dog 
hoarders, and finding new homes for the puppies. The puppies 
are all equally adorable, so she gives them away in a fair 
order by choosing the kth puppy every time she finds 
a new family. Given a list of names for 
a litter of puppies, figure out which puppy is the last one to 
be chosen. Josephus makes this puppy a special biscuit treat, finds it the 
last family, and starts on another litter of puppies.

## Spec
Input: a list of puppy names
Output: the last puppy to be chosen from a litter

Spec: Fill out the skeletons of CircularArrayList and CircularLinkedList to extend AbstractArrayList and AbstractLinkedList, respectively, so they can be used functionally as specified in the Josephus program. 

Already implemented:
 - JosephusSolver.java: this contains the main method, which is the entrypoint to your Java program. The main method contains code for running a Josephus-style iteration over circular data structures, specifically CircularArrayList and CircularLinkedList.
 - AbstractArrayList.java, AbstractLinkedList.java: abstract classes with the add(String s) method and the constructors implemented. Your CircularArrayList and CircularLinkedList will inherit from these classes
 - CircularArrayList.java, CircularLinkedList.java: the skeleton of these classes have been written for you, just so you know what the overall structure of the class should look like. You will need to replace the `throw new UnsupportedOperationException()` with your implementation code. Your code will look similar to (but slightly modified from) the basic data structure implementations in class. Remember that this is NOT a Bag, so we don't care about uniqueness at all here.

To run:
```
rm *.class                      # clean previous build files
javac JosephusSolver.java       # build project & compile java files
java -ea JosephusSolver             # run program, does not take in arguments
                                    # the -ea means enable assertions
```


##Recommended
* write tests for your code so you can just run the program and see which parts work/don't work
* make your tests highly automated (save test cases in variables so you don't manually have to pass in parameters from the command line).
This makes it easier for you to quickly iterate the process {write tests, write code, run tests, fix code}
* you can make more static methods in the JosephusSolver class, such as test1, test2, etc to test your data structures funtionality
* this currently uses [assert](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2758224/what-does-the-java-assert-keyword-do-and-when-should-it-be-used) statements to verify correct results
but that means you need to pass in a flag to show when our tests don't pass. another approach
is to write completely separate tests that print the output and if it was different
from your expected output



##RECENT FIXES
- fixed location and method signatures of the remove() iterator methods and the remove()
list method; added comments and explanations of different remove methods; also added a
removeAll() method.  See commit [22e7938](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/cmsi281/commit/22e7938babb1f31a307f8d474d799f53fa2b09c2) for the change.
- fix bug in abstract list instantiation for second constructor (the bug was that I forgot to
initialize any of the instance variables in the second constructor). See commit [c336872](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/cmsi281/commit/c3368720f74e48dbd76f25f092a35cd46c3677e8) for the change.
